(* pred.while

  This program computes the predecessor of the
  natural number (in unary encoding) in case
  the input does encode a natural number.
      
  Exceptional case: if the input is 0 (nil),
  the program returns 0 (nil) as -1 is not
  a natural number.

  On non-numbers it has obviously the effect of returning
  the tail of the input tree.
